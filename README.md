Paid by the minute iOS version

Visit paidbytheminute.org for the web app version


One time my boss was telling me that he doesn't mind when customers waste his time because he "gets paid by the minute". 
SO, obviously, I made an app that tells you how much your making even though a someone is wasting your time. 
This is perfect for a teacher who constantly tells her classroom "I'll wait". For the guy who just can't seem to 
stop wathcing the clock at work, watch this instead. To the bosses who want to motivate their employees. Or just if youre 
bored and wan't to see how much you could be making. Anyways, enjoy I guess lol.
